pipes
=====
introduction
-----
This is a project is implementing an interactive interface for coding where input, processing, output are nodes of a pipe.  There is inspiration taken from spreadsheet software, where people are coding but they don't know it.  Data file (in,proc,out) nodes are related through a pipes file.  The current interface being developed is a web interface where you will be able to edit nodes, and see changes made to your entire system as updates are completed.

I am still working on the grammar for the pipes files, which describes the network of nodes for a pipe project.  Naming of all of these things is still open to change.

Currently I am not concentrating on any kind of authorization/authentication on a pipes interface.  This might not even happen, unless it's found necessary for pipes to be hosted on a public server.  Pipes may change into a custom GUI interface so that higher bandwidth output nodes (render windows) might be used.

Description of components here will be completed when I've organized some of this prototype code a bit better.
